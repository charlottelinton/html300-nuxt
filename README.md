<h1>Course Project Proposal</h1>
<p>I will create a website for a fictional arthouse cinema named Merlin Movie House. I have previous experience managing websites for 
film festivals and cinemas, so I am very knowledgeable about the kind of functionality they require. Features of the site will include:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A respnosive navbar for better mobile experience.</li>
 <li>A gallery page to showcase photos of the space.</li>
 <li>An FAQ page with a bootstrap accordion menu.</li>
 <li>The use of the OMDB API to pull in film information.</li>
 <li>A blog for posting keyword-rich, relevant content.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Site Analytics and SEO</h2>
<p>SEO is very important in order for a site to feature in a strong position in search engines. To give my site the best chance of being found
by searchers I would:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Conduct Keyword Research: Using a keyword research tool such as Google Keyword Planner or SEM Rush, I would conduct research into the top
 keywords I should be including on my site. I would also research the keyords that my top competitors rank for and begin targeting those terms
 in my content.</li>
 <li>Link to and from Reputable Sites: A few tactics for doing this could be:
  <li>Linking to authoritative film reviews for movies playing at the cinema.</li>
 </li>
</ul>
